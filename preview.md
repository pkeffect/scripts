- ‚è≤Ô∏è **Flexible Cooldowns**: Set global, category-specific, or item-specific cooldown periods
- üö´ **Item Restrictions**: Use blacklist or whitelist mode to control which items can be cloned
- üìä **Detailed Analytics**: Track cloning statistics, resource usage, and more
- üì± **User Interface**: Optional UI to display clone information and controls
- üìà **Wipe Cycle Management**: Reset clone limits automatically with each server wipe

## üìù Logging and Data Storage

### Logging Options

- Console logging (configurable)
- File logging (configurable)
- Log file: `ItemClonerAdvanced-Logs.txt`

### Data Storage

The plugin maintains two separate data files:

1. **Player Data** (`ItemClonerAdvanced_Data.json`):
   - Tracks individual player clone usage
   - Records clone history per player
   - Stores wipe cycle information

2. **Analytics Data** (`ItemClonerAdvanced_Analytics.json`):
   - Tracks most frequently cloned items
   - Records resource spending patterns
   - Monitors permission tier usage
   - Logs common errors and success/failure rates

### Clone Record Tracking

For each clone operation, the plugin records:
- Item shortname and display name
- Amount cloned
- Item condition
- Skin ID
- Timestamp
- Resource costs

## üîÑ Cloning Process

The plugin performs the following checks before cloning:
1. Permission verification
2. Active item validation
3. Item restriction checks
4. Cooldown verification
5. Clone limit validation
6. Resource cost calculation
7. Resource availability check

If all checks pass:
1. Resources are deducted
2. Item is cloned with appropriate quality based on tier
3. Cooldown is applied
4. Clone record is saved
5. Analytics are updated

## üåê Localization

The plugin includes a comprehensive localization system that can be customized for different languages. All user-facing messages can be translated through the language file.

## üîÑ Auto-Reload System

The configuration auto-reload feature monitors the config file for changes and automatically reloads the plugin when changes are detected. This allows for live configuration updates without server restarts.

## üîÑ Wipe Detection

The plugin automatically detects server wipes and resets clone limits accordingly. It uses a combination of server startup time and last wipe timestamp to determine if a wipe has occurred.

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

- Data is saved periodically (configurable interval)
- UI is updated efficiently only when needed
- Configuration loading is optimized for performance
- Error handling ensures plugin stability

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Item Quality Control

Different tiers can have different quality multipliers, affecting the condition of cloned items. Higher tiers can produce higher quality clones.

### Complex Item Cloning

The plugin properly handles:
- Items with condition
- Items with contents (containers, weapons with attachments)
- Weapons with ammo
- Items with instance data (blueprints, skins)

### Analytics Dashboard

Administrators can access detailed statistics on:
- Most cloned items
- Resource usage patterns
- User tier distribution
- Common errors and success rates
