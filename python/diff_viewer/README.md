## üí° Tips

- For best results, compare files with similar formats
- Monospaced fonts like Consolas, Courier New, or Source Code Pro work best
- The syntax highlighter automatically detects the file type based on content and extension
- Use keyboard scroll or mouse wheel to navigate through the files
- Both panes scroll synchronously for easy comparison
- When editing files, save them using the "Save A" or "Save B" buttons
- Use "Edit Mode" to make changes to files directly within the application
- The history feature remembers up to 10 recent file pairs
- An asterisk (*) before the filename indicates unsaved changes

## üîÑ Troubleshooting

- If syntax highlighting doesn't appear correctly, try selecting a different style
- For large files, give the application a moment to process the diff
- If the application crashes unexpectedly, check the console log for detailed error messages
- If file comparison options like "Ignore Whitespace" don't seem to work, try toggling the option off and on again
- When "Fold Equal" is enabled, large identical blocks will be collapsed - click "Re-Compare" to refresh the view
